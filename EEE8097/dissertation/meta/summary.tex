Physically Unclonable Functions are a relatively recent area of active research which can be seen as analogous to hardware fingerprints that potentially offer a way to provide low-cost, automated, trustworthy authentication of embedded systems.
As the infrastructure of networked devices grows in our homes and workplaces so too will the need to protect ourselves from `Hardware Trojans' and other threats.
In reviewing the state-of-the-art of `PUF's' and their potential incorporation into modern ciphers as cryptographic primitives using fuzzy extractors, the general significance and worth of an investigation into the implementation of practical Ethernet message authentication codes using Static RAM PUFs and Fuzzy Extractors as the core components is to be shown.
